EduHome - Online Classroom System

Abstract
The online classroom is a very popular platform for the education system. Many countries are now enforcing the online classroom system so that the teachers and students can communicate with each other. For example a very common and known to all ‘Google Classroom’. This online classroom system provides many facilities like shared materials, assignments, grade students, create unlimited courses, add students in there, etc. This is a great opportunity for every educational institute to enlarge and ease their education system. After the covid-19 breakdown, most of the educational institutes all around the world went into the online classroom system. They are using many online classroom platforms like ‘TalentLMS’,’ Google Classroom’, ‘visme’, etc. So, we have got the motivation to make this online classroom system for teachers and students. Our Eduhome online classroom system has some similar features like ‘google classroom’ but we have added some different features to it. Also, our classroom had some extra features that can help the teachers to teach their students more efficiently. Our Eduhome online classroom provides some facilities that can be highly mentioned. We have made a whiteboard feature where a teacher can easily draw so that she/he can teach the students more understandably. Also, our system provides an opportunity to see how many students are online in a specific class whenever a teacher creates a class according to the schedule. Also, in the scheduled class, the teacher and students can get a feature where they could start conversations. So, our EduHome online system has some significant facilities that a teacher or a student can utilize for their educational purpose.
